> ## Mine: 
### - Phase 1 would mean not many things are available, but I would try going for elementals 
####     - Phase 2 there is abusable elemental invasions, but I don't wanna write about them anywhere yet, because if I am into this game then, I will abuse the heck out of the time-tracking and behavior sheet of the spawns that I made back in Classic :D I was obsessed with these for some reason
